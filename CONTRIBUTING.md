# Contributing

This is a personal coding challenge, but improvements, corrections, and alternative solutions are welcome.

## Reporting a Mistake

Open an Issue and include:
- The phase folder and filename
- What the problem is
- A suggested fix (optional)

## Submitting an Alternative Solution

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your file as `filename_alt.py` in the same folder as the original
3. Open a Pull Request with a short explanation of your approach

## Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Add a comment at the top of your file explaining what the problem solves
- Keep each file self-contained — avoid unnecessary imports for basic problems

## Questions

Feel free to open a Discussion if you have questions, want to share progress on your own challenge, or want to suggest a problem for a future phase.
