## About

This repository is a public record of my **365-problem Python coding challenge**. Problems are solved across five structured phases — from syntax basics to CPython internals and data structures & algorithms.

**Started:** February 14, 2025 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Goal:** 365 problems total &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Completed:** 15

Progress is counted by problems pushed to this repo, not by calendar day. Some sessions have 1 problem, some have 10 — the only rule is the cycle completes at 365.
